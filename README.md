Problem solving with Algorithms
=========================

There are some typical approaches/techniques such as Divide-and-conquer, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, Branch-and-Bound... etc. that can help us organize the thinking by solving algorithm problems. Personally, I will suggest you to get at least some basic information of these approaches before or after you starting with the problems.

Presently I am not finished yet with all the problems on the LeetCode. I've tried to solve them with possible good time and space complexity (no warranty, I am still working on it). Though you could use my test cases to check more or less the correctness of your own solution before you commit them to the LeetCode. The unit tests are not perfect either, so welcome improve them.

By the way, there are predefined data structures in the util package with diverse useful methods e.g. array to tree converter, tree printer, array to linkedlist converter etc. Feel free to use or extend them for simplifying the tests.

enjoy solving!
