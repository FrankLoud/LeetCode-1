Problem solving with Algorithms
=========================

There are some typical approaches/techniques such as Divide-and-conquer, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking, Branch-and-Bound... that are useful for designing algorithms and solving problems. Some of these approaches are described in the book "Algorithm Design and Applications" of Michael T. Goodrich & Roberto Tamassia. I personally will suggest you to get at least some basic information of these approaches before or after you starting with the questions.

Leetcode provides a library with more than 160 questions. I am not finished yet with all of them. I've tried to solve these problems with good time and space complexity as far as possible (no warranty, I am still working on it). Though you could use my test cases to check more or less the correctness of your own solution before you commit them to the Leetcode. The unit tests are not perfect either, so welcome improve them.

Besides I have committed the predefined data structures into the util package as well with diverse useful methods e.g. array to tree converter, tree printer, array to linkedlist converter etc. Feel free to use them or extend them for simplifying the tests.

enjoy solving!
