LeetCode Algorithm Problems
=========================

I am not finished yet with all the problems on the LeetCode. I've tried to solve them with possible good time and space complexity (no warranty, I am still working on it). Though you could use my test cases to check more or less the correctness of your own solution before you commit them to the LeetCode. The unit tests are not perfect either, so welcome improve them.

In the util package are predefined datastructures with diverse useful methods e.g. array to tree converter, tree printer, array to linkedlist converter etc.

enjoy solving!
